%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have put a demo of the "edRVFL-FIS" model with the "cardiotocography_3clases" dataset
We have three variants of edRVFL-FIS as follows:
	1. edRVFL-FIS-K if you choose clus=1 in edRVFL_FIS_main.m file.
	2. edRVFL-FIS-C if you choose clus=2 in edRVFL_FIS_main.m file.
	3. edRVFL-FIS-R if you choose clus=3 in edRVFL_FIS_main.m file.
 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The experimental procedures are executed on a computing system possessing MATLAB R2023a software, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8260 CPU @ 2.30GHz, 2301 Mhz, 24 Core(s),
48 Logical Processor(s) with 256 GB RAM on a Windows-10 operating platform.

Remarks:

	1. The codes have been cleaned for better readability and documented, then re-run and checked the codes only in a few datasets, so if you find any bugs/issues, please write to M. Sajid (phd2101241003@iiti.ac.in).
 
	2. For the detailed experimental setup, please follow our paper.
